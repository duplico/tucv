TU CV
-----

1 - Introduction

TUCV is a LaTeX package for producing a CV or resume. It is based upon the 
shaded resume style, originally by Matthew Boedicker. The capabilities 
it provides are inspired by the University of Tulsa's Cyber Corps resume 
format; it is inclined to produce a somewhat lengthy, detailed document.

Up to date source files for this package are available at its bitbucket 
repository at <https://bitbucket.org/duplico/tu-cv>.

Detailed documentation can be found in tucv.pdf, which may also be 
generated by running pdflatex on tucv.dtx.

Source and PDF output of a sample CV with dummy content is provided in 
tucv_ex.tex and tucv_ex.pdf.

2 - Installation

The tucv package provides a single style, tucv.sty, which is generated 
by running latex on tucv.ins. To use, place tucv.ins in a directory 
searched by the latex compiler.
